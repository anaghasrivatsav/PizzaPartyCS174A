This project will essentially be an interactive pizza creator. In our game the user starts off with a
blank pizza crust as a base. There will be several steps. At each step the user will be able to further 
customize their pizza by adding different sauces, cheese, and toppings throughout the game. At the 
end, the user can bake and view their completed pizza! 

The topics used from the course include: Transformation Matrices (using transformation matrices like scale and rotation for adding the toppings and the sauce), Shaders (using different kinds of shading and shaders to provide more texture and depth to the different toppings,  sauce, and cheese), TextureMapping (create and wrap our own textures around different toppings, the crust, the sauce, and the cheese to showcase their unique texture).

 In terms of interactivity, The screen first starts off with a blank circular pizza crust. Below will be buttons for choosing which sauce to add. After clicking the  sauce button, the sauce will be added on the screen, and the button options will now include a cheese button for the user to add cheese to their pizza. After clicking on that button, the cheese will be added. Then the screen will be changed so that 4 new buttons will be available to indicate topping options for the pizza, as well as a ‘bake’ button. Once each button is clicked, it will be grayed out so that the user can’t re-click it. Everytime a topping is added, the toppings will be added on screen and as they are being added they will spin and slowly stop as if a force of friction is acting on them. After adding the toppings they want, the user can click the bake button and then the pizza will slowly burn/bake and the color of the pizza will slowly turn darker and the cheese will ‘melt’ till the user clicks the ‘done’ button. After the done button is clicked then a new screen with the same level of ‘burntness’ of the pizza will show up. Then a ‘start over’ button will appear on screen and if the user clicks on that, then it will go back to the original page.

The Advanced Feature we implemented for our project was a physics based simulation of the rotational velocity equation. We rotated the toppings on the pizza when initially placed and had them slow down in rotation as if a frictional force is being applied to the topping. (Please note that the olive topping rotates as well, however since it is a perfect torus shape it is difficult to see)
